# Georgia Tech's ECE 2031 - Digital Design Laboratory (Summer 2023)
The goal in ECE 2031 is to experience the conception, design, fabrication, and testing of digital
hardware in a hands-on setting. Laboratory projects will use a PC-based CAD tool environment that supports schematic capture,
logic simulation, and VHDL-based logic synthesis on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).
Discrete logic devices will be used for two designs, but VHDL-based logic synthesis on FPGA-
based design boards will be used for more advanced design implementations. The semester will
culminate with a design project specified and undertaken by teams of four to five students.
Technical communication skills are developed through laboratory reports, project documentation,
and an oral presentation.
## Course Objectives
As described [here](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/courses/course_outline/ECE2031), the objectives for
students are to
1. Apply their knowledge from ECE 2020 (or CS 2110) to practical laboratory experience in
digital computing systems.
2. Apply the concepts of basic combinational logic circuits, sequential circuit elements, and
programmable logic in the laboratory setting.
3. Develop familiarity and confidence with designing, building and testing digital circuits,
including the use of CAD tools.
4. Develop team-building skills and enhance technical knowledge through both written
assignments and design projects.
## Course Outcomes
Also from the ECE web site, upon successful completion of this course, students should be able
to be able to do the following:
- Implement combinational logic circuits both with TTL devices on a protoboard and
within a complex PLD.
- Analyze the timing of digital circuits with oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.
- Design and implement state machines to meet design specifications.
- Design circuits with a graphical schematic CAD editor.
- Simulate circuits within a CAD tool and compare to design specifications.
- Design, implement, and simulate circuits using VHDL.
- Implement a simple computer within a PLD.
- Write machine language programs and assembly language programs for the simple
computer.
- Use a complex sequential logic circuit as part of a solution to an open-ended design
problem.
- Write laboratory reports and documentation conforming to technical writing standards.
- Work effectively as team members to develop and write a group report.
- Work effectively as team members to design an approved project.
